When you have more than one keyboard layout your can easily switch between them using `CTRL+Space`

I had to enable this setting first but that was relatively easy to do:

* Open System Preferences
* Open Keyboard
* Open ShortCuts
* Select Input sources
* Check the "Select the previous input source" checkbox
