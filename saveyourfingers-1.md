*Save your fingers - lesson 1 - NPM*

We are programmers. We type a lot. Let's save our fingers and make the precious keystrokes we do, count!

There's quite a lot of shortcuts to be found in the `npm` command. Here's a few that I've found very useful:

* `npm install` can be abbreviated to `npm i`

* `npm run-script` can be abbreviated to just `npm run` (y'all probably did that already)

* Running tests is a very common script. Hence you don't need to use `run`. The full abbreviation phase is this:

  * `npm run-script test` can become `npm run test` and can become
  * `npm run tst` or `npm run t` and finally
  * `npm t`

* Similary the `npm run-script start`  doesn't need the `run` part either and can become `npm start`
