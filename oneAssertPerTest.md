The tests that we are writing becomes the documentation (or specification) for how our code should behave. Therefor itâ€™s really important to write clear and easy to understand test.

They are also much easier to manage if each test only tests one single thing.

Compare these two test-sections:
```javascript
it('a newly created user is a valid user', done => {
    const user = createNewUser();
    assert.notEqual(user.name, '');
    assert.notEqual(user.name, 'Marcus');
    assert.equal(user.age < 1, true);
})
```

to

```javascript
it('a newly created user username cannot be empty ', done => {
	const user = createNewUser();
	assert.notEqual(user.name, '');
})
it('a newly created user username cannot be Marcus ', done => {
	const user = createNewUser();
	assert.notEqual(user.name, 'Marcus');
})
it('a newly created user age cannot be less than 0', done => {
	const user = createNewUser();
	assert.equal(user.age < 0, true);
})
```

If the age setting functionality is changed and validates the rules the message, for the failing test, will be much clearer in the second batch of tests
